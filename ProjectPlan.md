Overview: Describe the overall goal of your project.

The goal of our project is to explore the relationship between recent global environmental trends and economic outlook over the past 5 years. Negative climate change impacts have led to more intense and frequent natural disasters, loss of biodiversity, and food scarcity. The impact on local communtities can impose threats on future economic developments and resiliance. However, the impact felt may differ siginifcantly from country to country, so we aim to reflect differences in economic impact related to environmental changes across the globe. We plan to analyze datasets within climate patterns such as emissions or natural disasters, and economic indicators including GDP, unemployment, average household income and more to accomplish our goal. Analzying the ongoing patterns between the environment and economy can guide future policy decisions and bring awareness to scope of climate change impact. 


Research Question(s): What is/are the question(s) you intend to address?

  Some research questions we plan to address include:

  What types of natural disasters cause the most economic stress?

  How has the frequency and severity of climate events changed over the past 5 years?

  What is the relationship between economic strains from climate events and overall economic outlook across different countries?

  What are some factors that impact a countries ability to recover from environmental impacts?

  Are economic costs from environmental disasters increasing or decreasing over the past few years?

Team: Clearly define team member roles and responsibilities

Veronica Liu: Data acquisition and preprocessing, workflow automation, storage, data integration and ethical constraints
Maggie Cheng: Metadata documentation, data integration, analysis and visualizations, data quality assessments

Datasets: Identify and describe the two datasets that you will use. If you are looking for ideas for datasets to use, please reach out via Campuswire.

"Global Climate Events and Economic Impact Dataset (2020-2025)" from Kaggle. This dataset explores over 3000 recent climate events with important metrics such as type, country, and severity. It also indicates the economic impact of event in dollars, cost of international aid, and impact per capita. This dataset will be key to exploring patterns in severity and economic impact between different countries over time. This dataset is sourced from Google and is in CSV format.

"World Developoment Indicators" from World Bank Group. This is a comprehensive dataset including key statistics on economics and the environement. This dataset holds more macroeconomic global trends as well as environmental indicators such as co2 emissions and economic reslience. 

Timeline: Document the plan and timeline for implementing your project including who will complete each task. Your plan must clearly address each of the requirements described above
1. Identify key regions for analysis. Initial data exploration and Data Lifecycle mapping. (Veronica)
2. Clean and create a master dataset (Maggie)
3. Normalize and assess quality of the dataset. Further break down data into cost, changes in frequency and severity, etc. (Veronica)
4. Create visualizations and compute statisical results for factors impacting climate recovery (Maggie)
5. Create outline of findings and create report of findings (Both)


Constraints: Describe any known constraints.
The "Global Climate Events and Economic Impact Dataset" is using estimates which leaves a level of uncertainty. It may also be difficult to find a direct cause between economic strain and outlook due to the type of data in the dataset if we are using methods such as regression.


Gaps: Identify any known gaps or areas where you need additional input.
"Economic strains" may be a bit broad and defining the exact metrics could improve our analysis. Clearly defining 'severity' and 'stress' will help with quantitative analysis. We would also need to specific the variables if we were to do regression analysis.
