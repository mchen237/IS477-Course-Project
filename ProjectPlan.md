Overview: Describe the overall goal of your project.

The goal of our project is to explore the relationship between recent global environmental trends and economic outlook over the past 5 years. Negative climate change impacts have led to more intense and frequent natural disasters, loss of biodiversity, and food scarcity. The impact on local communtities can impose threats on future economic developments and resiliance. However, the impact felt may differ siginifcantly from country to country, so we aim to reflect differences in economic impact related to environmental changes across the globe. We plan to analyze datasets within climate patterns such as emissions or natural disasters, and economic indicators including GDP, unemployment, average household income and more to accomplish our goal. Analzying the ongoing patterns between the environment and economy can guide future policy decisions and bring awareness to scope of climate change impact. 


Research Question(s): What is/are the question(s) you intend to address?

Some research questions we plan to address include:

What types of natural disasters cause the most economic stress?

How has the frequency and severity of climate events changed over the past 5 years?

What is the relationship between economic strains from climate events and overall economic outlook across different countries?

What are some factors that impact a countries ability to recover from environmental impacts?

Are economic costs from environmental disasters increasing or decreasing over the past few years?
